-- Getting Things Healed (original)
-- v1.0.0 - First publish.

-- v1.1.0 - Added one more main tank (MT5) to basic assignment list. Added phase and assignment sorting, both in menus and broadcasts/replies. Added brief whisper reply message format; whispers now return full report only with 'heal! all'. Added player preset saving/deleting. Fixed phase renaming (it works now). Added talent inspection. 

-- v1.1.1 - Minor patch. (1) Fixed whisper reply reporting, so healers not explicitly assigned will still be told about "all remaining" assignments. (2) Fixed oRA main tank assignments so that they automatically grab MT names from oRA during reporting, even if names not explicitly in assignments (MT1, MT2, etc.). (3) New assignments are sequentially numbered, so you can now make several before you rename them. (4) Saving presets uses most recently loaded preset name as default save name, in the editbox. (6) Localization infrastructure in place, and first-pass deDE included. (7) Improved talent scanning, by moving out-of-range targets to end of queue. (8) Added "Cancel" button to "Save as" dialog. (9) Formatting changes to reports, to make them easier to read.

-- v1.1.2 - (1) Added frFR translations! (2) Some minor bug fixes to whisper reports and talent scanning. (3) Polls default UI main tanks, if oRA tanks not available. (4) Healer selection menus now stay open after selecting an individual healer's name. (6) Replaced "Raid" and "Channel" broadcast buttons with a menu that allows raid, channel, whisper. This also removes that awful text box for channel. (7) Use 'Rescan talents' at bottom of healer menu to force a rescan of all talents. (8) When loading a preset, current preset is saved to a buffer, so it can be reloaded using the "Previous preset" command in the preset menu. This allows one undo a preset load, to reload trash assignments between boss fights, or otherwise work back and forth between two assignment sets.

-- v1.1.3 - Bugfix for frFR and deDE custom assignment naming.

-- v1.1.4 - (1) Hopeful bugfix: Rare error when members leave the raid. (2) Maintank wildcard naming: Assignments containing the text %MT1 will substitute the name of main tank 1. (3) Made naming boxes auto-focus and highlight.

-- v1.2.0 - (1) Preset auto-fill system added. Saved presets remember (a) healer names, (b) healer class/spec, and (c) count. On preset load, GTH tries to fill assignments in that priority, matching specific healer names first, trying to find a healer of same class-and-spec next, and finally filling remainder with any healer up to the number required. (2) Broadcast button sends assignments for currently displayed phase only, on shift-click. (3) Icons added to indicate different priest healing specs. (4) '/gth broadcast' command added, so broadcasts can be macro'd.

-- v1.2.1 - (1) fixed preset-load talent-test bug.

-- v1.2.2 - (1) Feature: Optional auto-broadcast when an assigned healer dies. Broadcast announces death and dead healer's assignment. Spirit of Redemption aware (priests sometimes die twice). (2) Bugfix: Whisper broadcasting works again. (4) Bugfix: Priest talent spec icons more flexible and accurate now.

-- v1.2.3 - (1) Added Spanish localization. (2) Bugfix: Default-UI maintank names works again.

-- v1.3.0 - Updated for WoW 3.0. 

-- v1.4.0 - New features: (1) Broadcasting turns off automatic death broadcasts from other raid members with GTH. This stops death spam from multiple people. (2) Simple assignment sharing. Control-click on Broadcast button copies preset to other raid members who have GTH. (3) Arbitrary ordering of phases now possible. Use the up/down commands in the phase menu to move the currently displayed phase up or down in the list of phases. (4) Options menu consolidates context-free GTH options and provides some new ones. It is the little gear icon just left of the presets menu. (5) Verbose/concise broadcast modes added. Use the Options menu to toggle. (6) Disconnects announced in same manner as deaths. Uses a separate toggle. (7) New preset system, moving built-in presets to optional external add-ons. (8) Channels with number less than /4 should display in channel list now.

-- v1.4.1 - Bugfix release. (1) Fixed disconnect event typo. (2) Fixed odd occasional phase delete bug.

-- v2.0.0-2.0.5 - Drag-drop conversion release. Healer drop-down menus are gone. These are replaced by a pool of drag-able healer names. These can be dragged to the assignment targets, located where the healer drop-down menus used to be. Once there, drag them among the assignments at will. Hold down shift while hovering over the pool of available healers to see values of inspected talents. Uninspected healers show a '?' icon. Bugfix: Updated SendChatMessage calls for AceComm-3.0 ChatThottleLib (mandatory non-nil prefix).

-- v2.0.6 - (1) Fixes for main tank wildcarding (%MT#). Can use more than one in same string now, e.g. "%MT1 and %MT2" substitutes both tank names in. Also now doesn't catch "MT" without the "%" in front. (2) Added reset slash command, "/gth reset", that wipes saved variables, in case they get corrupted. (3) Death and disconnect announcements only fire for healers assigned explicitly. Just being available isn't enough. (4) Improved handling of long broadcast strings.

-- v2.0.7 - (1) Sets session broadcast flag to false initially. Thus you won't get any death or disconnect announcements until you broadcast at least once. (2) Added Death Knight talent tree icons. (3) Bugfix: using "/gth reset" after having a multi-phase preset caused a table corruption. Fixed.

-- v2.1.0 - Update for Patch 3.1. Handling of dual talent specs.

-- v2.2.1 - Scans secondary talents, now, and considers a player a tank or healer if either talent spec is a tank or healer spec.

-- v2.3.0 - Various optimizations and LDB plug-in support

-- v2.3.1 - Fixed assignment sharing; Added preset name filtering by current zone, when shift held when the menu is clicked.

-- v2.3.2 - Roster of healers/tanks now saves across sessions, to make planning easier.

-- v2.3.3 - Right-click populate pool to remove from roster (when not in a raid) or rescan talents (when in raid)

-- v2.3.4 - bugfix for mysterious talent scanning error one user has been reporting (likely conflict with another addon?)

-- v2.4.0 - Added auto-detection of talent spec swaps. Bugfix for DE localization.
